# AICTE Internship Potato Leaf Disease Detection
Potato leaf diseases, such as early blight and late blight, can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Detecting these diseases early is crucial for effective management and protection of potato crops.

## Methodology
Data Collection: A dataset of images of potato leaves, both healthy and diseased, is collected. These images are sourced from platforms like Kaggle.

Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality. This may include resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to increase the dataset size.

CNN Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and trained to classify the images.

Training: The CNN is trained using the dataset, with a typical split of 70% training data and 30% testing data. Techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation are employed to improve performance.

Testing and Validation: The trained model is tested on a separate set of images to evaluate its accuracy. The accuracy of the model is measured by its ability to correctly classify healthy and diseased leaves.

## Results and Benefits
Studies have shown that CNNs can achieve high accuracy in detecting potato leaf diseases, with some models reaching over 90% accuracy. This automated detection system helps farmers take timely measures to mitigate the impact of diseases, leading to improved crop yields and reduced production costs.

Early Detection: Enables early identification of diseases, allowing for prompt intervention.

Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for manual inspection and minimizes crop losses.

Scalability: Can be applied to large-scale farming operations.
